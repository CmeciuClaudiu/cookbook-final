 1.Everyone:
 -Gets DTO recipes from the API (see https://github.com/CmeciuClaudiu/cookBookAPI) sorted by 5 categories (first-course, main-course etc..) puts them into a grid view and on click renders the recipe details (ingredients, preparation instructions etc.)
 
 2.Simple users:
 -You can change your username or user email for now, but in the future there's a posibility to implement review systems and adding recipes to favourite section.
 
 3.Administrator:

 Other mentions: All data validation is made in both frontend and backend part of the application.
